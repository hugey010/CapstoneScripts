In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

                 "message": "\"A  Problem Shared is a Problem Halved.\"<br><br> ****So often we are taught to keep everything to ourselves. The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

Another way to get in the middle of the bed is to REALLY LISTEN HARD at meetings. Give a smile to someone. Shake a new person's hand. When we start acting a new way, our thoughts and feelings will follow.",

                 "message": "\"Give It Away to Keep It.\"<br><br>****If you help someone else, you will be helped.  If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  If you want to stop fantasizing or obsessing on using, help someone else stay sober. This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.  To be clear, a lake must have an inflow and an outflow.” Twenty Four Hours A Day, Nov. 2.",

Don’t worry about why you're an alcoholic, food addict or drug addict or any other kind of addict. Just look at your drinking, use and drug history, and if your use, drinking, eating, etc. caused you trouble, admit you're an addict and focus on recovery.Too many relapses are caused by trying to determine why one drank or used addictively. For example, coming to the conclusion that a stressful marriage surrounded uncontrolled drinking leads one to erroneously think that fixing the marriage will allow one to drink normally. The truth is that once you're an addict (regardless of whether it's to internet, alcohol, food, opiate, etc.) , nothing will fix your addiction except abstaining from picking up that first one. Changing your geographical location, fixing stressors, changing your friends- nothing will allow you to use your drug of choice safely again.",

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

Had I not heard that I should pick up the phone instead of a drink endlessly during the first 30 days of my meeting attendance, I would never have picked up the phone and called my Sponsor when tempted to drink on day 31.

                 "message": "    \"Don’t Say “How Are You” and Not Wait for the Answer.\"<br><br>****It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

When I have this attitude, I am falling victim to the impossible desire for my life to be complete with nothing left to do. The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.”",
                 "message": "\"Life is not an emergency.\"<br><br>For me, ordinary duties become emergencies when  I (1) feel I have to get everything done that I write in my calendar, (2) fear that if I put even small things off they’ll just build up so that I’ll never get to them, and (3) don’t schedule enough time between appointments. I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

                 "message": "\"Lower Your Expectations\" <br><br>One way to ruin our serenity and head for a relapse  is to have too high expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well.Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.",

So what if you got a bad haircut.  You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

                 "message": "\"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but you can always feel OK.\"<br><br>Do you feel like using because you just lost something. The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free.  Ask for their health, prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free.

                 "message": "\"A  Problem Shared is a Problem Halved.\"<br><br> ****So often we are taught to keep everything to ourselves. The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.

If you want to feel less self conscious, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  If you want to stay sober, help someone else stay sober. This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.

I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>We need to change from needing to be understood to wanting to be understanding. When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue’ was a noted physician in the 1920's. He described how he helped his patients heal themselves from such diseases as rheumatism, tubercular sores, paralysis, fibrous tumors and ulcers by autosuggestion. He is credited with the phrase, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.”",

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

                 "message": "\"Lower Your Expectations\" <br><br>We have unrealistic expectations if we think we don't make mistakes. One way to ruin our serenity and head for a relapse  is to have unrealistic expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

                 "message": "    \"Don’t Say “How Are You” and Not Wait for the Answer.\"<br><br>****It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue’ was a noted physician in the 1920's.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

Honesty is admitting that your excuse to use your drug is insane.\"O\" stands for open-mindedness. Open-mindedness means discarding what you think will keep you sober and following what someone else says will keep you sober.\"W\" stands for willingness. You must be absolutely desirous to stay sober.That is HOW you begin to not pick up the first drink.",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

High expectations cause us to feel overwhelmed.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well.Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude.

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.  Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find  your defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will make you angry. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.     Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.  By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, \"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"",

That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

I remembered how supportive he had been over the years. As I consciously told myself of reasons to be grateful for him, my anger dissipated and I actually relaxed and felt happy. If you can't think of a reason to be grateful for something that the offending person did for you, focus on the fact that the person has given you the opportunity to practice good character attributes like patience and forgiveness and understanding. This practice will help improve your personality and make it easier the next time someone interferes with your rights.",

They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.  Once you commit to change, you can learn and implement strategies which can keep you sober.",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Yet how many of these ends of the world do you remember from even yesterday?  Relax.  Have a sense of humor.  So what if you got a bad haircut.  You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship.

                 "message": "    \"Don’t Say “How Are You” and Not Wait for the Answer.\"<br><br>****It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

Never trust your first thought because it usually is wrong. Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a reaction.  In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.",

We let go of the need to have our opinions accepted and followed. In recovery, we learn to keep our eye on the prize. That prize is being a part of a loving group that is staying sober as a team.

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a reaction.  In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.",

Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue’ was a noted physician in the 1920's.

Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.”",
                 "message": "\"Life is not an emergency.\"<br><br>For me, ordinary duties become emergencies when  I (1) feel I have to get everything done that I write in my calendar, (2) fear that if I put even small things off they’ll just build up so that I’ll never get to them, and (3) don’t schedule enough time between appointments. I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

High expectations cause frustration and stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude.

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

When I have this attitude, I am falling victim to the impossible desire for my life to be complete with nothing left to do. The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.”",
                 "message": "\"Life is not an emergency.\"<br><br>For me, ordinary duties become emergencies when  I (1) feel I have to get everything done that I write in my calendar, (2) fear that if I put even small things off they’ll just build up so that I’ll never get to them, and (3) don’t schedule enough time between appointments. I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue’ was a noted physician in the 1920's. He described how he helped his patients heal themselves from such diseases as rheumatism, tubercular sores, paralysis, fibrous tumors and ulcers by autosuggestion. He is credited with the phrase, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.”",

                 "message": "\"I don't have to like it; I do have to accept it.\"<br><br>One winter, I woke up, looked out the window and saw snow. Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

                 "message": "\"A  Problem Shared is a Problem Halved.\"<br><br> ****So often we are taught to keep everything to ourselves. The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

It is a prescription for misery for you and everyone around you.  Instead make a decision to change your attitude now so that you can be happy now.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

When we simply live the experience without making it all about me, we avoid \"pity parties\" or \"egocentric grandiosity\" which used to lead us to use.

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

When I have this attitude, I am falling victim to the impossible desire for my life to be complete with nothing left to do. The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.”",
                 "message": "\"Life is not an emergency.\"<br><br>For me, ordinary duties become emergencies when  I (1) feel I have to get everything done that I write in my calendar, (2) fear that if I put even small things off they’ll just build up so that I’ll never get to them, and (3) don’t schedule enough time between appointments. I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.",

That's why  someone  who picks up a drug after a period of sobriety usually has such  prompt dire consequences. The reason someone thinks of picking up a drug is because of a trigger, like stress. Someone may also be in denial after a period of sobriety, thinking that there is no longer a problem or that no problem really ever existed. This denial causes the addict to think that meetings are no longer necessary. That is why it is so important to talk to someone if you start questioning whether or not you are an addict so that you can be reminded of where your drug use took you.",

Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

                 "message": "\"Lower Your Expectations\" <br><br>One way to ruin our serenity is to have too high expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause frustration and stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.",

My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.  Once you commit to change, you can learn and implement strategies which can keep you sober.",

Don't write down things that happened in previous days.  Just jot down good things that happened that day. This exercise will make you feel like life is good.

To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.  Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find  your defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem.

Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.     Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.

                 "message": "    \"Don’t Say “How Are You” and Not Wait for the Answer.\"<br><br>****It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.  This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.  Once you commit to change, you can learn and implement strategies which can keep you sober.",

So don't abandon a recovery program thinking that medications alone will keep you sober. Medications might decrease the high you feel from using, but they won't keep you from either abusing the medication or discontinuing it because you will still be spiritually bankrupt (empty) as a result of your addiction. In my practice, I see so many miserable opiate addicts on suboxone. Most (if not all) relapse. Many end up mixing methadone with benzodiazepines. I also see a few happy addicts on suboxone who diligently practice the 12 steps. I also see many more simply not taking any medication and diligently working the 12 steps and feeling great.

Give the spiritual solution a try even if you feel you currently have philosophical differences with 12 step programs.If you are trying to stay sober, you cannot rely on medications like suboxone or antidepressants to keep you sober. So don't abandon a recovery program thinking that medications alone will keep you sober. Medications might decrease the high you feel from using, but they won't keep you from either abusing the medication or discontinuing it because you will still be spiritually bankrupt (empty) as a result of your addiction. In my practice, I see so many miserable opiate addicts on suboxone. Most (if not all) relapse. Many end up mixing methadone with benzodiazepines. I also see a few happy addicts on suboxone who diligently practice the 12 steps. I also see many more simply not taking any medication and diligently working the 12 steps and feeling great. The bottom line is using any drug does not take away the emptiness that was the basis for your using.",

If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free.  Ask for their health, prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free.  Even when you don’t really want it for them, and your prayers are only words and you don’t mean it, go ahead and do it anyway.  Do it every day for two weeks and you will find you have come to mean it and to want it for them, and you will realize that where you used to feel bitterness and resentment and hatred, you now feel compassionate understanding and love.”  P.552 of the Big Book.At first, any normal, rational person will think that praying for the welfare of someone who has wronged us is insane.  I know I did.  Nevertheless, this theory is at the centerpiece of many recovery strategies and  religions.

First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.  Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else.

If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  If you want to stay sober, help someone else stay sober. This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free.  Ask for their health, prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free.  Even when you don’t really want it for them, and your prayers are only words and you don’t mean it, go ahead and do it anyway.  Do it every day for two weeks and you will find you have come to mean it and to want it for them, and you will realize that where you used to feel bitterness and resentment and hatred, you now feel compassionate understanding and love.”  P.552 of the Big Book.At first, any normal, rational person will think that praying for the welfare of someone who has wronged us is insane.  I know I did.  Nevertheless, this theory is at the centerpiece of many recovery strategies and  religions. For example, the Bible repeatedly states that we are all sinners, but the difference between those in Heaven and those in Hell is that those in Hell never asked for forgiveness or forgave those who sinned against them.

If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

Medications might decrease the high you feel from using, but they won't keep you from either abusing the medication or discontinuing it because you will still be spiritually bankrupt (empty) as a result of your addiction.

It is a prescription for misery for you and everyone around you.  Instead make a decision to change your attitude now so that you can be happy now. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore sad feelings.  In fact, if you just gloss over, deny or ignore your sad moments, they will affect you sometime in some way.  It is better to admit you are sad and immediately take steps to deal with the sadness in a healthy way.  It’s okay to be sad.  But don’t wallow in it until it matures into self-pity or misery.

If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  If you want to stay sober, help someone else stay sober. This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free.  Ask for their health, prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free.  Even when you don’t really want it for them, and your prayers are only words and you don’t mean it, go ahead and do it anyway.

I know I did.  Nevertheless, this theory is at the centerpiece of many recovery strategies and  religions. For example, the Bible repeatedly states that we are all sinners, but the difference between those in Heaven and those in Hell is that those in Hell never asked for forgiveness or forgave those who sinned against them.

In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

                 "message": "\"Ask What’s Wrong\"<br><br>****Recovery does not only mean that you are healing; it also means that your relationships are healing. In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship. Start this process with an inventory of your resentments focusing on what you did to contribute to your resentment of the other person.Little kids are taught whenever you point the finger, there are four fingers pointing back at you.

                 "message": "    \"Don’t Say “How Are You” and Not Wait for the Answer.\"<br><br>****It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

If you want to feel better, the best way is to try to make someone else feel better.  If you want to stay sober, help someone else stay sober. This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

High expectations cause frustration and stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.",

If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

                 "message": "\"A  Problem Shared is a Problem Halved.\"<br><br> ****So often we are taught to keep everything to ourselves. The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship. Start this process with an inventory of your resentments focusing on what you did to contribute to your resentment of the other person.Little kids are taught whenever you point the finger, there are four fingers pointing back at you.

Sometimes we feel like it is more important to be correct philosophically, than it is to be open to trying a new philosophy that might keep us sober. In recovery, we gradually learn not to let these things bother us so much. We learn to let go of being dependent on convincing others what is right politically or religiously. We let go of the need to have our opinions accepted and followed. In recovery, we learn to keep our eye on the prize. That prize is being a part of a loving group that is staying sober as a team. We learn that we need each other and that it is better to leave our differences aside and help each other. We learn that it is beneficial to try this new way of life and the new philosophy of the 12 steps even though we may not fully under stand them or even agree with them. We learn to have faith in the program because we have seen it work in other people's lives. We truly learn that it doesn't matter whose opinion is right, it only matters who stays clean and sober.",

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

One way to ruin our serenity is to have too high expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause frustration and stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude.

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take. Your sharing of a feeling may facilitate another to express his or her feelings, and few things make others feel better than honestly sharing feelings. ",

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

It is of course commonplace to say “How are you?” when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don’t even wait for a response. “How are you?” has taken the place of “Hi.” It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don’t care about them if you don’t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one’s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the “How are you?” inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a “How are you?” question with the word “Fine.” “Fine” is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings. It is good to share feelings with caring people.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, “Peoplemaking,” Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he’s asked how he feels, he will answer, “Fine,” because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?” P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple “How are ya’” in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your “How are ya’?” At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him “How Ya Doin’?”  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.  Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems.  Perhaps just asking your spouse “How ya Doin?” without expecting any specific response will show your love.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, “You know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.”  She replied, “I know what you mean, it’s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.”I made eye contact with her and smiled.  I already felt a lot calmer.  She then smiled mischievously and said, “You know, you can say a prayer I like to say.  It goes like this..Dear God, please give me patience, and give it to me now!”We both laughed.  I felt much better.  I felt really connected and my sense of humor was restored.  My heart pounding stopped.  I was glad to share the wait with her.  It was just great to know that I could turn to a complete stranger and honestly share my feelings. I am sure it probably made her feel better too. I had gotten what I needed: patience (and interestingly) I had in fact gotten it NOW.  Honestly asking for help with a negative feeling is often a good risk to take.

When I have this attitude, I am falling victim to the impossible desire for my life to be complete with nothing left to do. The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.”",
                 "message": "\"Life is not an emergency.\"<br><br>For me, ordinary duties become emergencies when  I (1) feel I have to get everything done that I write in my calendar, (2) fear that if I put even small things off they’ll just build up so that I’ll never get to them, and (3) don’t schedule enough time between appointments. I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don’t get everything done today, it’ll pile up and then I’ll be “under the gun.”   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, anxiety will melt away.",

                 "message": "\"Lower Your Expectations\" <br><br>One way to ruin our serenity is to have too high expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause frustration and stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one’s expectations does not require lowering one’s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let’s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn’t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn’t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.   By the time I find the number, I’m still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a  positive attitude.

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

You don't always have to be whooping it up. Sometimes you may be sad or anxious because of a difficulty, but you still qualify as a happy person if you don't turn temporary sadness or anxiety into misery. \"Free\" means you can \"wake up\", not \"come to\" with a hangover. A friend was doing well with \"happy\" and \"free\" but struggling with \"joy\" until his Sponsor asked him, \"What is the first thing that comes to your mind that you are grateful for and did not create?\"  My friend replied, \"Well I woke up today, I didn't come to\" and spontaneously laughed with joy!",

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue’ was a noted physician in the 1920's. He described how he helped his patients heal themselves from such diseases as rheumatism, tubercular sores, paralysis, fibrous tumors and ulcers by autosuggestion. He is credited with the phrase, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.”",

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

To renew trust and understanding, sweep your side of the street by making amends without blaming the other person or allowing your own shame to stop your positive change.

                 "message": "\"Ask What’s Wrong\"<br><br>****Recovery does not only mean that you are healing; it also means that your relationships are healing. In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship. Start this process with an inventory of your resentments focusing on what you did to contribute to your resentment of the other person.Little kids are taught whenever you point the finger, there are four fingers pointing back at you.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a reaction.

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

The most effective strategy I have learned to deal with losing is to redefine winning. Today I define winning as dealing gracefully with the outcome. If I can maintain a peaceful, yet resiliant attitude when the outcome goes against my will, then I have truly won.I also tell myself that it is God’s will not mine that counts. I tell myself that God knows what is best for me, and that he has not yet given me anything that I cannot handle.I also allow myself time to appropriately grieve the loss. I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game.I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law  school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer. I was forced to go out on my own. I did so not with a sense of dejection but with a sense of adventure. And ultimately, owning my own firm has yielded for me incredible success and pleasure. Failing to get what I first wanted, a big firm job when I graduated from law school, was one of the best things that could have happened to me.When I don’t let feelings of loss discourage me, I have courage to keep heading in a successful direction. I take the dis out of discourage, and get my courage back.  True victory is maintaining serenity regardless of whether we win the trophy, or qualify for the loan or see our face on the television or sell the book or get the applause. It comes from our relationship with our Higher Power and others. It comes from within. As the recovery saying goes, “victory is an inside job.”",

One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship. Start this process with an inventory of your resentments focusing on what you did to contribute to your resentment of the other person.Little kids are taught whenever you point the finger, there are four fingers pointing back at you.

                 "message": "\"Remember Love Means Saying You’re Sorry\"<br><br>****When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O’Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called “Love Story.”   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, “Don’t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you’re sorry.”  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person’s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person’s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like “when I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I’m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.” Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person’s feelings - you’ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you’re sorry.

You don’t have to go through the seven stages of death.  Nothing is going to put that hair back on your head but time.“Wear the world like a loose garment” is a very relaxing motto.  It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don’t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don’t turn problems into drama.  Don’t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not “for that 20 year old” linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.  ",

This is the concept of the 12th step.  In other words, “Give it away to keep it.”“Give it away to keep it” is the fundamental principle of recovery from addiction.  “Give it away to keep it” focuses on one person helping another.  AA is based on one “drunk” helping another.  AA was started when someone who wanted to stay sober knew he had better try to help another alcoholic or else he would pick up that first, fatal drink.  He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I’ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I’ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   “ Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.  But if you selfishly try to keep all for yourself, you are soon blocked off from God, your source of supply, and you will become stagnant.

In early recovery, staying sober is enough. Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest  answer, don’t argue.  Another’s feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense.  Don’t expect to understand or agree with the other person.  Don’t try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you.  Simply say “thank you for telling me.”  Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified.Let’s assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong.  Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving.  At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship.  Without such knowledge, no progress can be made.You’ll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship. Start this process with an inventory of your resentments focusing on what you did to contribute to your resentment of the other person.Little kids are taught whenever you point the finger, there are four fingers pointing back at you.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God’s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn’t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  “Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.” page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.  For example, unless you accept your boss, spouse, child, neighbor, etc. as being exactly the way that person is supposed to be at that moment, you will be disturbed. ",

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.” Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don’t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn’t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe’s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn’t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn’t figure out a solution.  Joe’s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe’s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied “Oh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I’ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.”  Joe replied “Why don’t you just ask your wife to make you something else?”.  The friend replied “I’m not married.” The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.  But the first step is to admit that we have a problem with bologna sandwiches and that we are making them ourselves.  Once you commit to change, you can learn and implement strategies which can keep you sober.",

We should, however, exercise caution with regard to who we do the 5th step with. It is your responsibility to find a person who is duty bound for confidentiality.

                 "message": "\"The 2500 ton phone\"<br><br>Our egos weigh things down. It's not the problem that's heavy; it's our perception that's heavy. One heavy perception that needs to be made much lighter is our fear, embarrassment, shame of picking up the phone and sharing a problem with another person. Had I not heard that I should pick up the phone instead of a drink endlessly during the first 30 days of my meeting attendance, I would never have picked up the phone and called my Sponsor when tempted to drink on day 31. Going to meetings helps lighten the weight caused by our ego defenses which have been getting fed for so long before we got clean. Picking up the phone helps us share what we are feeling so we can feel better.",

Do you think of a reason to deny someone's strategy to help you before they are even finished with their plan? Lots of addicts hear but don't listen. Lots of addicts hear what others say in offering help, suggestions, and feedback, but respond by saying, \"Yes, but…\" Addicts hear then assert that the suggestions won't work, or that they are against the addict's principles. Addicts defend these principles with their sensitive grandiose egos. Remember, it's OK (and necessary) to follow good orderly direction without understanding why. Expect not to understand, just have faith and truly listen. You will then have the openmindedness necessary to honestly accept whether or not you are an addict. And if you are an addict, you will then be able to practice an effective recovery program. This will reduce stress.",
